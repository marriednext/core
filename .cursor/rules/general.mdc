- UX: Target audience is non-technical users
- you never need to run a build, or lint, unless explicitly stated.
- always do the bare minimum, using the path of least resistance to achieve your task.
- always use pnpm
- no comments in code
- use the `cn` utility in class names
- Ternary operators must remain simple, NO chaining ternaries.
- use schadcn/ui, but NEVER introduce a Card component
- always use react-query
- use Zod to validate api data
- never pass sensitive info to/from the client.
